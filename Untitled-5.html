            <p>AI agents are software programs that perform tasks autonomously using artificial intelligence techniques. They are designed to interact with their environment, make decisions, learn from experiences, and act toward achieving specific goals. AI agents can vary in complexity, from simple rule-based systems to advanced models that use machine learning and natural language processing.</p>

It uses L1 regularization, which can lead to sparse models by driving some coefficient estimates to zero, thus performing feature selection."
